# EE577A_PrelabB
This repository contains EE577A Prelab B, focusing on Timing Parameter Analysis of inverters. It includes simulations to measure propagation delay, rise/fall times, and the impact of transistor sizes, capacitance, and input transition time. Automated delay analysis using Liberate scripts and output variation analysis are also included.
